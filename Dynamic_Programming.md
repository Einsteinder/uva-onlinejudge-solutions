# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem 
by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing 
the same results again.

The classical example on a problem that's best solved using Dynamic Programming is 
Fibonnaci, this is the naive recursive implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
	if n==0: return 0
	elif n==1: return 1
	else: return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)

```

In my laptop **fibonacci(38)** took 42 seconds to compute. Now if we use Dynamic Programming and 
store the intermediate results we have:

```python
def fibonacci(n, mem={}):
    if n in m:
        return mem[n]
    
    if n==0: fib = 0
    elif n==1: fib = 1
    else: fib = fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)

    mem[n]=fib
    return fib

```

Which computed **fibonacci(38)** in 0.096 seconds more than fast enough in most cases, but sometimes
python's recursion depth limit makes an iterative solution the only alternative:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
	mem = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
	mem[1] = 1
	for i in range(2, n+1):
		mem[i] = mem[i-1]+mem[i-2]

	return mem[n]
```

With this approach **fibonacci(30000)** took 0.190 seconds to compute.  


The only way to learn how to apply dynnamic progamming is to see how the process work with a few examples, 
and solve problems until it clicks. I recommend the videos below as a starting point.

## Problems

### Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

The Longest Increasing Subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence 
in which all the subsequence's elements are in sorted order.

### Find the longest path in a matrix with contrains

Given a *n√ón* matrix where numbers all numbers are distinct and are distributed from range 1 to *n<sup>2</sup>*, 
find the maximum length path (starting from any cell) such that all cells along the path are 
increasing order with a difference of 1.

### Longest Common Subsequence

The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all 
sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from problems of finding common substrings: 
unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences

### Recursion with Memoization

Memoization is a technique that is associated with Dynamic Programming. The concept is to cache the result 
of a function given its parameter so that the calculation will not be repeated; it is simply retrieved, 
or memo-ed. Most of the time a simple array is used for the cache table, but a hash table or map 
could also be employed. [\[Algorithmist\]](http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Memoization)
