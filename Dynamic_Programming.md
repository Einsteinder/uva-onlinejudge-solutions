# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem 
by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing 
the same results again.

## Problems

### Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

The Longest Increasing Subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence 
in which all the subsequence's elements are in sorted order.

### Find the longest path in a matrix with contrains

Given a *n√ón* matrix where numbers all numbers are distinct and are distributed from range 1 to *n<sup>2</sup>*, 
find the maximum length path (starting from any cell) such that all cells along the path are 
increasing order with a difference of 1.

### Longest Common Subsequence

The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all 
sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from problems of finding common substrings: 
unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences

### Recursion with Memoization

Memoization is a technique that is associated with Dynamic Programming. The concept is to cache the result 
of a function given its parameter so that the calculation will not be repeated; it is simply retrieved, 
or memo-ed. Most of the time a simple array is used for the cache table, but a hash table or map 
could also be employed. [\[Algorithmist\]](http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Memoization)
