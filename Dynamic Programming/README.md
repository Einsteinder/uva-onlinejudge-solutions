## Problems

### Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

The Longest Increasing Subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence 
in which all the subsequence's elements are in sorted order.

### Find the longest path in a matrix with contrains

Given a *n*n* matrix where numbers all numbers are distinct and are distributed from range 1 to *n<sup>2</sup>*, 
find the maximum length path (starting from any cell) such that all cells along the path are 
increasing order with a difference of 1.
